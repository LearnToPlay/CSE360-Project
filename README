/************** WampServer 2.2 **********************/
Import Warren's data.jar file into your jitt project on Eclipse.
	This should have the entity files with main() methods for unit testing.
	Refer to these main() methods to see how to use them.

Start up Wamp and make sure the icon in the lower left corner is green.
Click on that icon and go to phpMyAdmin. From Warren's email:

  "From the main page click on the SQL 'tab' and copy all the contents
   of the localhost.sql file and paste them into the SQL window in WAMP
   and click the 'Go' button."

You should get a new database called jitt.
Go to it by clicking on the sidebar to the left or by clicking the database tab.
You'll see the database tables Warren's made.
From this screen you can click "Insert" to add data to whatever table.
When clicking on a Table, you'll be able to "Edit", "Copy", or "Delete" the data you added.
