Before working on the project you must pull all the new commits. 
Here's how:

  cd ./CSE360-Project
? git remote add upstream git://github.com/LearnToPlay/CSE360-Project
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/master


After (Forking, Cloning,) Fixing, Fetching and Merging: (watch for 'username')

  git add -A
  git commit -m 'Your message here'
  git push git@github.com:username/CSE360-Project.git

Then go to username/CSE360-Project and send a Pull Request.
DONE!

There's probably an easier way (shorter) to do this line:
  git push git@github.com:username/CSE360-Project.git
I'm just not sure what it is.
